## Flutter TUI

Imagine writing terminal user interfaces with Flutter's syntax!

```dart
void main() {
    runApp(Center(child: Text("Hello, World!")))
}
```

![Hello, World](docs/images/hello_world.png)

> This is a quick sample done in a couple of hours. I plan to make this a full-blown project over the summer with a better and clearly-defined architecture that closely models Flutter's.
